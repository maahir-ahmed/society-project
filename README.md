# Society Platform

Web app for running a university society committee: content requests, room bookings, treasury reimbursements, printing, member management, and a Rubric ([hellorubric.com](https://hellorubric.com)) portal. Built for UNSW Security Society but works for any society.

## Features

**Requests**
- **Content requests** — marketing workflow. The list is ordered by event date, colour-coded by how close the event is, and each status tab shows a count. Marketing directors upload finished graphics, paste the event blurb, and tick items done. Rubric event links generate a transparent QR code automatically.
- **Room bookings** — Arc booking requests, with a warning when external guests need 7 business days' notice.
- **Treasury** — reimbursement claims with amount-based multi-executive approval (≥ $50 needs the treasurer). Owners can edit claims and add/remove receipts while a claim is still pending. Bank details saved per user.
- **Printing** — club printing requests costed against a per-tier secretarial budget (Bronze/Silver/Gold), approved by execs; approved requests draw down the budget.

**Spending budget** (exec-only tab) — the yearly budget tracker, replacing the committee's spreadsheet:
- **Current Year** — each category's 2026 budget vs live spend (summed from classified treasury claims), with % used/left bars and an unclassified bucket.
- **History** — archival 2024/2025 budgets, 2025 usage, worst case, and the reasoning/notes behind each figure. Everything is editable in-app.
- Submitters pick the category on the treasury form; execs can reclassify any claim from the budget tab.

**Rubric portal** — reads events, ticket sales, members, grants, and settlements from Rubric, and submits events (including the Arc affiliation form). Executives see everything; directors see the Events tab only.

**Platform**
- Roles: Executive, Director, Subcommittee, with a shared exec queue for anything needing action.
- Per-society branding (logo/banner upload, colours), member directory, titles, notifications, and an audit log.
- Single-society mode: set `SOCIETY_SLUG` to serve one society at the root domain (clean, slug-free URLs).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install

# local Postgres
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

cp .env.example .env
# set AUTH_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 32) and DATABASE_URL

npm run db:push      # apply schema
npm run db:seed      # demo society + accounts
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`. The seed prints demo logins (password `password123`).
